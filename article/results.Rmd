# Biomass



<!-- 1.  shade x distance ( @ordway2020 ) + timber sp? -->
<!-- 2.  height ( @ordway2020 ) -->
<!-- 3.  wood density ( @poorter2019 ) -->
<!-- 4.  total biomass x dist ( @ordway2020 ) + timber sp? -->
<!--   -   maybe system-level curve (e.g. biomass hist) + timber sp -->
<!--   -   metric hist, vs. sp-abund/diversity hist below -->
<!--     -   max DAP as trait? -->

<!-- [RESULTS TEXT] -->


```{r fig1data}
wd <- filter(plotResultsTbl1, variable == "spg") #alias
stems <- filter(plotResultsTbl1, variable == "stems") #alias
stems12 <- filter(plotResultsTbl12, variable == "stems") %>% distinct() #alias
```


Aboveground biomass did not tend to change with distance to primary forest edge 
(Fig \@ref(fig:biomass)a), despite significant trends with underlying related variables 
(Fig \@ref(fig:biomass)).

Median plot wood density tended to increase marginally significantly 
(`r glue("p=",round(as.numeric(wd$pval),3))`) 
with edge distance by 
`r round(wd$statPrint[[1]]$estimate[[2]],4)` ± 
`r round(wd$statPrint[[1]]$std.error[[2]],5)` per m 
explaining 
`r "R2x100"`% of variance 
among median distance strata values
(Fig \@ref(fig:biomass)b).

Plot stem density also tended to increase significantly 
(`r glue("p=",round(as.numeric(stems12$pval[[2]][2]),2))`) 
with edge distance but more strongly and non-linearly, by 
~`r round(stems12$statPrint[[1]]$estimate[[2]],2)` ± 
`r round(stems12$statPrint[[1]]$std.error[[2]],2)` per m 
(Fig \@ref(fig:biomass)c).

At this stage in forest regeneration, canopy light availability did not tend to change with distance from forest edge 
(Fig \@ref(fig:biomass)d).

# Composition



<!-- 1.  richness -->
<!-- 2.  diversity x distance [+ 1 timber sp] -->
<!--   -   can break down by diversity index -->
<!--     -   compare to NMDS? -->
<!--   1.  system-level curve (e.g. rank-abund) x distance [+ 1 timber sp] -->


```{r fig2data}
entropy <- filter(plotResultsTbl1, variable == "entropy") #pReplaced
entropy12 <- filter(plotResultsTbl12, variable == "entropy") %>% distinct() #slopeR2
richness <- filter(plotResultsTbl1, variable == "richness")
ficus <- filter(taxaResultsTbl1, gen == "Ficus")
```


Overall diversity changed significantly with distance to primary forest edge 
(Fig \@ref(fig:taxa)).

Alpha diversity significantly 
(`r glue("p=",round(as.numeric(entropy12$pval[[2]][2]),3))`) 
decreased non-linearly by 
~`r round(abs(entropy12$statPrint[[1]]$estimate[[2]]),2)` ± 
`r round(abs(entropy12$statPrint[[1]]$std.error[[2]]),2)` per m 
as distance to primary forest edge increased 
which explained 
`r "R2x100"`% of variance 
among distance strata medians 
(Fig \@ref(fig:taxa)a) -- 
while in contrast taxonomic richness increased slightly 
(`r glue("p=",round(as.numeric(richness$pval),3))`) 
and linearly 
by 
`r round(richness$statPrint[[1]]$estimate[[2]],2)` ± 
`r round(richness$statPrint[[1]]$std.error[[2]],3)` per m 
and had `r "R2x100"`% variance explained 
among distance strata 
(Fig \@ref(fig:taxa)b).

Community composition and beta diversity also changed significantly 
(`r glue("p=",round(ordStat$aov.tab[[6]][1],2))`) with 
`r round(ordStat$aov.tab$R2[1],2) *100`% 
variance among distance strata explained by distance to primary forest edge, 
and the first two principal components explaining 
`r ordTbl$PC1_prop[1] *100`% and 
`r ordTbl$PC2_prop[1] *100`% totaling 
`r (ordTbl$PC1_prop[1] + ordTbl$PC2_prop[1]) *100`% 
of variance among calculated plot distances 
(Fig \@ref(fig:taxa)d).

Key abundant taxa `r measure2e` and `r measure2f` showed different responses -- `r measure2e` nearly tended to decrease with distance to primary forest edge 
(Fig \@ref(fig:taxa)e),
while `r measure2f` decreased marginally significantly 
(`r glue("p=",round(as.numeric(ficus$pval),3))`) 
and linearly by 
`r round(ficus$statPrint[[1]]$estimate[[2]],2)` ± 
`r round(ficus$statPrint[[1]]$std.error[[2]],2)` per m 
with `r "R2x100"`% variance among distance strata explained 
(Fig \@ref(fig:taxa)f).

# Functions



```{r fig3data}
source(here::here("figs/fig3.R")); succession <- taxaResultsTbl12 #pReplaced
```


Overall functional regeneration highlighted successional stage associations over primary dispersal mode along distance to primary forest 
(Fig \@ref(fig:traits)).

Taxa associated with both early and late successional stages decreased significantly 
(`r glue("p=",round(as.numeric(succession$pval[[3]]),3))`) 
and curvi-linearly 
by 
~`r round(succession$statPrint[[1]]$estimate[[2]],2)` ± 
`r round(succession$statPrint[[1]]$std.error[[2]],2)` per m 
with distance to edge explaining 
`r "R2x100"`% variance 
among distance strata medians 
(Fig \@ref(fig:traits)a).

Dispersal modes did not show consistent trends in biomass with increasing distance to edge 
(Fig \@ref(fig:traits)b).
