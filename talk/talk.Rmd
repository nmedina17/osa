Outline
===

- Introduction
- Methods
- Results
- Discussion


I--Global forests are regenerating, but how?
===

- ~Half of forests are tropical, and over half of all forests globally are secondary *(FAO 2020)*

- Services like timber and biodiversity depend on natural and managed regeneration patterns

- Regeneration dynamics should be better understood


I--Regeneration is quick and inconsistent
===

- Biomass recovers 90% in 66 yrs *(Poorter et al 2016 PNAS)*

- Taxonomic richness recovers quickly ()

- Community composition may take centuries to recover, if at all *(Norder et al 2010 PNAS)*


I--Edges shape regeneration
===

- 70% forests are <1 km from a habitat edge *(Haddad et al 2015 Science)*

- Edges effects tend to reduce biodiversity by 13 - 75% via ... *(")*

    - stronger in small and isolated fragments


I--Edge effects may differ in wet tropical plantations
===

- 7% of global forests are planted and planted area has increased over last 30 yrs *(FAO 2020)*

    - Often dense with fast-growing, shade-intolerant taxa
    
- Wet tropical forest regeneration tends to be light-limited, based on tree functional traits *(Poorter et al 2021)*

- Existing plantation demography and shade may skew/buffer edge effects toward net positive instead of negative


I--This study
===

- Question -- How is wet tropical secondary forest regeneration affected by former plantation status and edges with road and primary forest?

- Hypothesis -- 

    - Former plantation status facilitates succession by allowing shade-intolerant taxa to grow better due to __denser canopies__
    
    - Forest edges promotes regeneration by faciltating __dispersal__ of shade-tolerant taxa

- Predictions -- Distance away from primary forest edge is associated with --

    - lower stand biomass
    
    - lower tree diversity
    
    - lower shade-tolerant taxa


II--Study site
===

- Wet tropical rainforest in Osa Peninsula, SW Costa Rica

- 20 ha plantation of dry forest timber, abandoned in ~2003 into NRDC preserve

- Area surrounded by primary forest on two sides and road on third

```


II--Census design
===

- Random stratified forest biomass inventory sampling design --

    - divided 300 m range into six 50 m strata, from forest to road edge, using QGIS and ArcGIS

    - 30, 21 x 21 m plots randomly distributed, but quantity roughly proportional to stratum area

    - All plots covered 1 ha total, 5% of entire plantation

II--Census measurements
===

- Stems â‰¥10 cm were measured for DBH and height using rangefinder *(Bushnell, Forestry Suppliers, Inc)*

- Taxa were ID'd with help from local field guides

- Plot canopy closure was measured with densiometer


II--Statistical analysis
===

- For all variables--

    - Trend lines follow median values of all plots in distance stratum
    
- Traits obtained from literature and compared to TRY database *(Kattge et al 2020)*
    
- Computations done with R `getRversion()` depending on *BIOMASS* `packageVersion("BIOMASS")`, 
*vegan* `packageVersion("vegan")`, and 
*tidyverse* `packageVersion("tidyverse")` packages


III--Stand regeneration
===

- Further from primary forest edge--

    - Biomass and wood density tended to increase

    - Stem density decreased then increased 

    - Neither canopy light nor height (not shown) tended to change
    
- Distance from forest edge tended to explain variation--

    - 10% in wood density
    
    - ~20% in stem density

III--Composition regeneration
===

- Further from forest edge--

    - Richness tended to increase

    - Diversity decreased steeply

    - Composition varied notably, toward PC1
    
    - Of abundant taxa biomass--
    
        - Vochysia tended to decrease
        
        - Ficus decreased

III--Functional regeneration

#     "figs/fig3.R"
#   )

```

IV--Hypothesis check
===

- Stand biomass is more resilient than biodiversity

    - Further from forest--
    
        - No trends in biomass
        
        - Diversity decreased

- Forest edge associated with tree diversity


IV--Processes underlying patterns
===

- not shade...

- dispersal...

- 


IV--Compare to similar studies
===

- aligns well with major recent papers

-

- 


IV--Future studies
===

- Compare wet tropical plantations at different stages of regeneration

- Compare forests with different initial composition but in similar region (i.e. realized vs. fundamental niches)

- Study ecological dynamics under various management conditions
